## Face Recognition using Python
This project is currently programmed for 3 people.  If you want to test this program then either you have to show the photo of those three people who are given in the images folder or you have to add your image to the images folder. And make sure while adding your image to the images any file is not added with it.

#Points to keep in mind
-> Suggested Python Version 3.7 or 3.7+
-> Before starting install all the required libraries using the pip 
-> Suggested Application: VS Code, PyCharm.
